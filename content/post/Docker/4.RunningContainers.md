In this post lets learn how to run containers

<!--more-->

We have lots of base images

    $ docker images
    $ docker run hello-world

### Lets pull docker/whalesay image which is built for study of docker


    $ docker search docker-whale

    $ docker pull docker/whalesay

    $ docker run docker/whalesay cowsay hello
    $ docker run docker/whalesay cowsay I AM DOCKER

    This container has cowsay application which displays hello

## How to know what all containers are running on our system

    $ docker ps

    Why output is nothing ? Containers run and stop.

## Get the list of containers which are stopped and I have run
    $ docker ps -a

    - Each container has unique ID
    - Command shows what executed when it started
    - NAMEs which are used to refer

    $ docker inspect hungry_booth

If docker is running then you can see ip address etc.

## Docker Network Interface

    $ ifconfig
        docker0:
        flags=4099<UP,BROADCAST,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.17.0.1  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
        inet6 fe80::42:b7ff:fee2:978e  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 02:42:b7:e2:97:8e  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 55  bytes 4903 (4.9 KB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0

  See the range of ip address which docker is going to assign to containers when they are running

  **We are not going to see how to configure the network of the docker interfaces**

## Lets start container and then inspect
      $ docker run -it centos:latest /bin/bash
          - run : run the container
          - i   : interactively
          - t   : connect it to terminal or tty
          - run centos latest
          - run /bin/bash command

Run following command in the container

        $ whoami

Now open another terminal and run following command It will show you the container is running

        $ docker ps
        $ docker inspect goofy_easley

To come out of the centos container

      [root@d0756568442e /]# exit

Exit terminate the container, now you can chech following command

    $ docker ps
    $ docker ps -a

Why it existed ? Its because the command we run is now terminiated so container


### To run container in the backgroud use -d option
    $ docker run -d centos:latest /bin/bash

    Here command executed and finished

### Lets run the nginx in the background mode
    $ docker run -d nginx:latest
    $ docker ps
Now here the container is running in the backgroud. It continues to run.

Now Lets inspect and find the ip address of the container which is running

    $ docker inspect focused_swirles
    $ ping 172.17.0.2

We are able to ping because the container is running

    $ docker ps
    also tell us that nginx has port 80

    So open the browser and put 172.17.0.2 you can also use elinks terminal based browaser to check the nginx webpage

    You can install elinks as follows

    $ sudo apt install elinks
    $ elinks http://172.17.0.2

Use q to exit

### To stop nginx container
    $ docker stop focused_swirles

## To start docker with name, start 2nd instance of nginx image
    $ docker run -d --name=MyWeb1 nginx:latest
    $ docker ps

    $ docker inspect MyWeb1
    $ docker stop MyWeb1

Ip address is from dhcp of docker interface, we we run another container it will get next ip from ip pool.

### To start container again
    $ docker container start MyWeb1
