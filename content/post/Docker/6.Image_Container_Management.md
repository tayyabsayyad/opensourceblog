In this post lets learn manage Image and Container

<!--more-->

### How to deal with images and containers

    $ docker images

### Delete image which is not used
    $ docker rmi centos:centos6

### Delete the image which is being used
    $ docker rmi hello-world

    This must give error, you can force but its better to first delete the Container

    $ docker rm Container-Name
    $ docker rm Container-ID Container-ID
    $ docker rm fd61930cb2b9


    By force you can delete image
    $ docker rmi -f hello-world

**If you remove images, you will be able to run the containers**

### To stop all non-running Container delete
    $ docker ps -a -q
    $ docker rm `docker ps -a -q`
