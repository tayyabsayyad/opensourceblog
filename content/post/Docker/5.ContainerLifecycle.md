In this post lets learn Container Lifecycle

<!--more-->

Lets have a look at all images we have

    $ docker images

Lets see whether we are running any Container

    $ docker ps

Lets see history of the Containers we run

    $ docker ps -a

## Lifecycle of Container
    $ docker run -d --name=LifeCycle1 nginx:latest
    $ docker ps
    $ ping 172.17.0.2

    Container is running, its ip must be 172.17.0.2

## Attach to the Container
    $ docker attach Lifecycle1

    you are attached to the process and not the coommand prompt

    Now if you put CTL + C then you will close the Container

    $ docker ps

## Restart Container
    $ docker restart Lifecycle1
    $ docker start Lifecycle1
    $ docker ps

## Run command in the Container with out affecting the Container process

    $ docker exec -it LifeCycle1 /bin/bash

      - exec execute command
      - -i interactively
      - attach to the tty / terminal
      - execute the /bin/bash command in the container

Now from here if you exit, container will not exit. It will continue to run

You have just executed and not attached. If you have attached then it would exit.

## Docker Stop
    $ docker stop LifeCycle1

## Docker Restart or start
    $ docker restart LifeCycle1
    $ docker ps
